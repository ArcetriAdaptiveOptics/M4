#PROCEDURE OTT#
def RS_verification():
    #caliball

# Mount the reference sphere in front on the RS
# Align the reference sphere to the RS
# Acquire a measurement
# Rotate the reference sphere
# Acquire a measurement
# Repeat points 4-5 until the residual measurement noise is below Test Pass Criteria
# Average the result to obtain the RS cavity
    pass

def PAR_verification():
# Mount the PAR
# Mount the INT
# Mount the CGH in front of the interferometer
# Align the CGH to the INT
# Align the INT+CGH to the PAR
# Acquire the measurement
# Post process the phasemaps to average WFE and WFE noise
    pass

def LAI_verification():
# To null the fringes:
#
# Mount the PAR
# Mount the RM and place it at the PAR center
# Remove the reference sphere
# Place a pinhole at the L1 focus
# Align the RM to have beam and return passing through the pinhole
# Align the RM to null the tilt fringes on the interferometer screen
# Align the PM and RM together to null coma on the interferometer
#
#
# To center the pupil:
#
# Identify the markers of the PM and its center.
# Adjust the pupil relay table to move it to the CCD center. Move table XY.
# Adjust the table tip/tilt to null the fringes.
    pass

def SAI_verification():
# Mount the flat reference mirror in front on the SAI. Adjust the flat tip/tilt
# Align the flat to the SAI
# Acquire a measurement
# Repeat point 3 until the residual measurement noise is below the Test Pass Criteria
# Average the result to obtain the SAI cavity WFE
    pass

def SPL_verification():
    #test 0087
    pass
