M4's Alignment Configuration File
=================================
Description
-----------
This python file is a configuration file to be passed to the alignment procedure,
which contains all the informations about the kinematic motors that move the
system and how to acces them through the higher level library.

How to Use it
-------------
Check the 'opt_alignment.py' library to see how it's used
